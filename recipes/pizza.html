  <h2>The Real Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza Dough</h2>

  <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 ⅛ cups warm water - 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ cup corn oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>butter as needed, for greasing</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; knead until dough holds together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. Turn to coat dough with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 6 hours.</li>
      <li>Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press dough into a 10-inch deep-dish pizza pan and follow your pizza recipe.</li>
   </ol>
